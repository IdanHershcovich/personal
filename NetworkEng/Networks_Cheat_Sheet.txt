* DHCP
    -Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    -Assigns unique IPs to hosts
    -Provides the subnet masks, DNS, default gateway
    -Can be client or server
    -A computer runs a DHCP client and that asks for a unique IP address.
    -A DHCP server manages the IP addresses. Runs on routers or servers
    -Uses UDP Ports
        -Client: 68
        -Server: 67
    -Steps:
        1. DHCPDiscovery: A client asks for a DHCP server on startup. 
        2. DHCPOffer: Server returns a offer (IP address) to the host.
        3. DHCPRequest: the client takes the offer from the host, and sends back a message saying it took the IP
        4. DHCPPACK: The server sends to the client a pack containing the IP address, the dns and gateway.

* DNS
    -Domain Name System
    -Maps domain names to IP addresses
    -Server that holds a bunch of domain names and their respective IP addresses

* Transport Protocols:
    -Packets structure:
        -Application
        -Transport (UDP, TCP)
        -Network
        -Link
        -Physical
    -Lets multiple applications use one network simultaneously 

* Transport Protocols:
    * UDP
        -User Datagram Protocol
        -Message oriented (mail)
        -Small packet sizes
        -No connection to create before sending data (handshake)
        -More control over when data is sent
        -No error recovery. Discard corrupted segments or returns a warning
        -No compensation on lost Packets
        -Can have wrong order 
    * TCP:
        -Transmission Control Protocols
        -Stream oriented(phone conversations)
        -More reliable, connection based (handshake)
        -Ask to establish a connection, wait for the okay, send packet.
        -Delivery acknowledgements from client to server
        -Retransmission
        -In-order delivery
        -Congestion control
        -Bigger header
* Network Protocols
    * IS-IS:
        -Intermediate System to Intermediate System
        -Uses Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
        -Not based on IP (unless we do Integrated IS-IS)
        -Bulk packet routing on an intranet.
        -Routing
            -Level 1: Routing within an area
            -Level 2: Routing between areas
        - Switching
        - Datagrams
        - Graph theory concepts {paths, directionality, path searching, etc}
    *BGP 
    -Border Gateway Protocol
    -Exchange information between autonomous networks
    -Deals with the way Autonomous Systems communicate on IP
    -Shortest path routing?
